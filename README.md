# Team Profile Generator

## Summary

The aim is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so there is a test for every part of the code to ensure that it passes each test.

## User Story
